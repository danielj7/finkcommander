<h2>Running Fink and Apt-Get Commands</h2>

<h3>Basics</h3>

<p>Running commands is straightforward.  If the command is package specific
(e.g. "install"), select a package or packages in the table and choose
the command you want from the source or binary menus or the toolbar.
To select more than one package, just shift- or command-click as you
would in any other table</p>

<p>To run a command that doesn't apply to specific packages
(e.g. "selfupdate"), simply choose the command from the menu or toolbar.</p>

<p>The <strong>toolbar</strong> has a number of available commands that are not included in
the default configuration.  To customize the toolbar, select
<kbd>Window:Customize Toolbar</kbd>.  In general, toolbar icons for commands 
relating to source packages are colored green and those relating to binary packages 
are blue.</p>

<p>When <strong>a command is running</strong>, the name of the command and (space
allowing) a list of the packages it applies to will appear as a text
message in the lower left-hand corner of the window.  When the command
is finished, a progress bar and the message "Updating table data" may
appear.  <a href="details/fc_tableupdate.html">More detail</a>.</p>

<p>While either of these processes is underway, the menu and toolbar items for
running commands will be disabled.</p>

<h3><a name="terminate">Terminating Commands</a></h3>

<p>You can ordinarily terminate commands by (1)  clicking the stop sign toolbar button, 
(2) pressing <kbd>cmd-.</kbd> on the keyboard or (3) selecting the 
<kbd>Tools:Terminate Command</kbd> menu item.  You should exercise caution in terminating 
Fink commands from FinkCommander. <a href="details/fc_terminate.html">More detail</a>. If the 
terminate command doesn't work, you will need to terminate FinkCommander's subprocesses manually.

<h3><a name="binary">Source vs. Binary</a></h3>

<p>The commands under the <kbd>Source</kbd> menu are run by the fink
package manager.  The commands under the <kbd>Binary</kbd> menu are
run by apt-get.  In general, fink handles packages available as source
code and apt-get handles packages available in binary form.  Hence the
menu names.</p>

<p>This dichotomy, however, does not always hold true.  For
example, if you install a source code package,
remove it and then reinstall it before a newer version becomes
available, the fink package manager will use the dpkg command to 
reinstall an archived binary package that it has stored on your system.</p>

<p>Note that some packages that are identified in the table as
binary cannot be installed by apt-get.

running <kbd>Binary:Install</kbd> produces an
error, try <kbd>Source:Install</kbd>.</p>
