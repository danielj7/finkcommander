<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><strong>Please note</strong>: A more current version of this document
may be available on the 
<a href="http://finkcommander.sf.net/help/faq.php">FinkCommander web site</a>.
</p>

<p class="question">
    Q1:  How do I respond to a prompt that appears in the command
    output when the interaction dialog fails to appear?
</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>
    Select the <kbd>Tools:Interact with Fink...</kbd> menu item. 
	Please consider <a
    href="http://finkcommander.sourceforge.net/help/bugs.php">
    submitting a bug report</a> as well, so the developers 
    can add the prompt to the FinkCommander output parser.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that these instructions apply to <em>all</em> prompts 
    from Fink, even those that simply ask you to &quot;Press any key
    to continue.&quot;  (<em>Don&#039;t</em> report that one; the 
    developers know about
    it and will fix it in the next release.)  The FinkCommander
    output view is not a terminal, so pressing a key will accomplish
    nothing.  You need to invoke the interaction dialog and click
    submit to send a key entry signal to the Fink process.

<p class="question">
    Q2:	FinkCommander is failing to display some/all of the packages
    in the table.  What&#039;s wrong?  How do I fix it?</p>
<p class="answer">
    In all likelihood, this is happening because you have installed
    Perl 5.8.  We are working on a FAQ about perl 5.8 
    compatibility.  In the meantime, you can find information on
    this subject by searching the finkcommander-users, fink-users
    and fink-dev mailing lists.</p>


<p class="question">
    Q3: I ran a command in Terminal using FinkCommander. Now every
    time I open a new Terminal window, that same command runs. Why
    does this happen? How do I fix it?</p>
<div class="answer"> 
<p>
  This happens whenever you open the &quot;Window Settings&quot;
  panel for a Terminal window that was opened to run a
  specific command and then click the &quot;Use Settings As
  Default&quot; button. The same thing would occur if, for
  example, you clicked that button for a Terminal window
  opened by BBEdit&#039;s &quot;Run in Terminal&quot; command.
</p>
<p>
  To fix this, terminate the offending fink or apt-get
  process and enter the following command in Terminal:
</p>
<p>
<kbd>defaults write com.apple.Terminal ExecutionString</kbd>
</p>
<p>
  If you can&#039;t get access to a functional Terminal window,
  then open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist
  in any text editor and delete the text between the
  &lt;string&gt;&lt;/string&gt; tags under the
  &lt;key&gt;ExecutionString&lt;/key&gt; entry.
