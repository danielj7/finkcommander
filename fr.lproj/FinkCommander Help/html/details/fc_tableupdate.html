<h3>Updating Table Data</h3>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="10">
<tr><td>
On startup and sometimes after a command is processed, a progress
indicator will appear in the lower right hand corner of the
FinkCommander window, and the message "Updating table data . . ." will
appear on the left.  This means that FinkCommander is running apt-get
and fink commands to obtain the information about available packages
displayed in the table.  The process is similar to the one Fink itself
engages in when you see the message "Reading package info . . ." in
the terminal. Completing this process necessarily takes some time,
although Fink 0.4.0 users may notice a substantial speed increase
compared to earlier versions.

<tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"><td>
<font="arial">To reduce the time taken to update the table after a
command, turn off "Always update with fink" in
<kbd>Preferences:General</kbd>.  FinkCommander will attempt to update
the table data itself after a command (other than selfupdate or
selfupdate-cvs) is performed.  The selfupdate commands always result
in a complete update of the table.</font>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
FinkCommander's update method is faster (pretty much
instantaneous) but less accurate than Fink's.  For example, if
installing a package results in the installation of dependencies,
FinkCommander will only update the status of the selected package.
</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"><td>
You can force FinkCommander to do a complete update of the table at
any time by selecting <kbd>File:Update Table Data</kbd>.
