<h3>Terminating Fink Processes</h3>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="10">
<tr><td>
<p>The FinkCommander terminate command searches for FinkCommander's descendant processes and 
runs <kbd>sudo -S kill -KILL</kbd> on each process.  The -KILL signal forces a process to 
terminate without running any cleanup routines built into to the program's signal
handlers.  The -KILL signal was the only one I could find that would terminate Fink
processes from FinkCommander with any reliability.</p>

<p>But occasionally, even this draconian approach doesn't work.</p>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"><td>

If the terminate command doesn't work, you will need to follow this
procedure to stop the current fink process:  
<ol><li>Quit FinkCommander.  The dialog following a failed terminate command will give you
		the option of doing this immediately.</li> 
	<li>Open Terminal.</li>
	<li>Type in <kbd>ps -acjx</kbd> and look for processes toward the end of the resulting 
		list that are owned by root and that appear to relate to the command you want to 
        terminate, such as <kbd>make</kbd>, <kbd>perl</kbd> or <kbd>cc</kbd>.  The process     
        owner is identified in the first column of the list.</li>
	<li>Run <kbd>sudo kill [process number]</kbd> on the first of these, where process     
        number is the the number in the second column of the list.</li>
	<li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all of the Fink related processes have terminated.</li>
</ol>
