<h2>Reading the Table</h2>

<h3>Version</h3>

<p>The number in the version column represents the most
recent available version of the package, taking into account whether
you have <a href="configuring.html#unstable">enabled</a> the installation of 
unstable packages.</p>

<h3>Binary</h3>

<p>An asterisk in the Binary column means that <emph>a</emph> binary version of the package
is available for installation by choosing the <kbd>Binary:Install</kbd> command.  
See <a href="running.html#binary">Running Commands:Source v. Binary</a> for more details.</p> 

<p>An asterisk in the binary column does <strong>not</strong> mean that the most recent 
version of the package is available as a binary.  In particular, if a package has an asterisk 
in both the binary and unstable columns, the binary version will generally not be the most 
recent.  Except for kde packages, unstable packages are not available in binary form.</p> 

<h3>Unstable</h3>

<p>If there is an asterisk in the unstable column for a package, it means
that the most recent available version is in the unstable tree.  It does
<strong>not necessarily</strong> mean that you have an unstable version 
installed.</p>

<h3>Status</h3>

<p>"Current" means you have the most current available version of a package installed.  
"Outdated" means that the package is installed, but a more recent version is available.
"Archived" means that you previously installed the package but removed it so that only
the debian archive remains on your system or that you ran the build command for a package
but have not yet installed it.</p>

<h3>Finding Packages</h3>

<p>FinkCommander provides two handy tools for finding the packages you
might be interested in installing or removing:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can sort the table by clicking on the column headers,
just as you can in Mail and other applications.  Click a header twice
in a row to reverse the sort order.</p></li>

<li><p>The toolbar in its default configuration includes a filter
that can be applied to most of the fields in the table.  (I didn't
think anyone would want to filter by version number.)  The filter
works incrementally, so that as you type or delete characters, the
contents of the table change to include only those packages that
satisfy your search criteria.  The package count also changes to 
reflect the table contents.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By combining the use of sorting and filtering, you can effectively
search the table with two criteria.</p>

<p>The table colums, by the way, can be resized and moved, and any
changes you make will be saved between runtimes.</p>
