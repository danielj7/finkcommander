 File: SBFileItemTree.h

 An SBFileItemTree models a directory tree for selected files in
 the file system.  Given a list of file paths, the buildTreeFromFileList
 method immediately creates a complete tree data structure consisting of
 SBFileItems representing each of the paths.  A lazy method would reduce
 memory consumption but would slow down the display.
