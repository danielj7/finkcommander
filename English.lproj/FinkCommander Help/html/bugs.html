<h2>Package-Specific Problems</h2>

<dl>
	<dt>Atlas install problem</dt>
	<dd><p>The atlas package install process includes a long interactive session where it's
		necessary to answer several questions from the command line.  When FinkCommander reaches
		this point in the process, it stalls and doesn't even print the prompts.  I'm not certain
		why this occurs, but using the FinkCommander interaction dialog to respond to all of the
		questions presented during the atlas install would in any case be tedious.  If you want
		to install atlas, you will need to do so in Terminal, either directly or by 
		running <kbd>Source:Run in Terminal:Install</kbd> in FinkCommander.</p>
	
    <dt>Tcsh and term-readkey-pm package problems</dt>
    <dd><p>Selection of tcsh or term-readkey-pm triggers a warning, because FinkCommander
        stalls when trying to install these packages from source.  Installing the binary or 
		installing source in the Terminal should work fine.  Please file a <a
        href="http://finkcommander.sourceforge.net/pages/bugs.html"
        target="top">bug report</a> if you encounter the same problem
        with another package.
