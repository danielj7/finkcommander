<h2>The Fink and Apt-Get Commands</h2>

<h3>Fink (Source Menu)</h3>

<em>The following consists primarily of excerpts from the fink manual.
To see the complete version, open Terminal and type &quot;fink man&quot; at the
prompt.</em>

<dl>
    <dt>Install</dt>   
    <dd><p>The install command is used to install packages. It downloads, configures,
           builds and installs the packages you name. It will also
           install required dependencies automatically, but will ask you for
           confirmation before it does so.</p></dd>

    <dt>Reinstall</dt>   
    <dd><p>Same as install, but will install the package via dpkg(8) even when
           it is already installed. You can use this when you accidentally
           deleted package files or changed configuration files and want to
           get the default settings back.</p></dd>
    
    <dt>Build</dt>   
    <dd><p>Builds a package, but does not install it. As usual, the source
           tarballs are downloaded if they can not be found. The result of
           this command is an installable .deb package file, which you can
           quickly install later with the install command. This command will
           do nothing if the .deb already exists.  Note that dependencies are
           still installed, not just built. </p></dd>
    
    <dt>Rebuild</dt>   
    <dd><p>Builds a package (like the build command), but ignores and over-
           writes the existing .deb file. If the package is installed, the
           newly created .deb file will also be installed in the system via
           dpkg(8).  Very useful during package development. </p></dd>
    
    <dt>Fetch</dt>   
    <dd><p>Downloads the named packages, but does not install it. This command
           will download the tarballs even if they were downloaded before. </p></dd>
    
    <dt>Remove</dt>   
    <dd><p>The remove command removes packages from the system by calling
           <kbd>dpkg --remove</kbd>.</p>

           <p>The remove command only removes the actual package files, but
           leaves the .deb compressed package file intact. This means that you
           can re-install the package later without going through the compile
           process again. If you need the disk space, you can remove the .deb
           from the /sw/fink/dists tree.</p></dd>    
        
    <dt>Selfupdate, Selfupdate-cvs</dt>   
    <dd><p>This command automates the process of upgrading to a new fink
           release. It checks the fink website to see if a new version is
           available. It then downloads the package descriptions and updates
           the core packages, including fink itself. This command can upgrade
           to regular releases, but it can also setup your /sw/fink/dists
           directory tree for direct CVS updates.  This means that you then
           will be able to access the very latest revisions of all packages.</p>
           
           <p><em>Note:  Selfupdate-cvs automatically uses CVS to obtain the latest
           revision.</em></p></dd>
    
    <dt>Update-all</dt>   
    <dd><p>This command updates all installed packages to the latest version.</p></dd>
	
	<dt>Force Remove</dt>
	<dd><p>	Force Remove will remove the selected package, even if other packages depend on it.  
			It should only be used as a last resort to resolve otherwise irreconcilable dependency 
			problems.</p></dd>  
			
	<dt>Utilities Submenu</dt>
	
	<dl>
	
		<dt>Cleanup</dt>
		<dd><p>Removes outdated .deb and source archives and broken links.
			</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Index</dt>   
		<dd><p>Rebuilds the package cache. You should not normally need to execute
			this manually, fink should auto-detect when it needs to be updated.</p></dd>
			
		<dt>Scanpackages</dt>
		<dd><p>Creates the files (Packages.gz in the binary-darwin-powerpc directory of each tree)
			necessary to allow apt-get update to work.
			</p></dd>
	
		<dt>Describe</dt>   
		<dd><p>This command displays a description of the package you name on the
			command line.  Instead of calling the fink describe command, it provides
			the same information from a cache maintained by FinkCommander.</p>
			
			<p><em>Note:  The <kbd>Tools:Show Package Info</kbd> and Toolbar info
			commands provide the same information as the describe command in a 
			separate window with active links to the package web site and
			maintainer e-mail address.</em></p></dd>

<dl>

    <dt>Install</dt>   
    <dd><p>All packages required by  the  package(s) specified for installation will also be             
           retrieved and installed.</p></dd>

    <dt>Update</dt>   
    <dd><p>Update is used to resynchronize the package index files from
              their sources.  An  update
              should  always  be  performed  before  an  upgrade.</p></dd>
    
    <dt>Upgrade</dt>   
    <dd><p>Upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all  pack-
              ages currently installed on the system.</p></dd>
