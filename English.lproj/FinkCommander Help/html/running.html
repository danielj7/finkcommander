<h2>Running Fink and Apt-Get Commands</h2>

<h3>Basics</h3>

<p>Running commands is straightforward.  If the command is package specific
(e.g. "install"), select a package or packages in the table and choose
the command you want from the source or binary menus or the toolbar.
To select more than one package, just shift- or command-click as you
would in any other table.  Since the table isn't editable, you can
also drag across rows to select them.</p>

<p>To run a command that doesn't apply to specific packages
(e.g. "selfupdate"), simply choose the command from the menu or toolbar.</p>

<p>The <strong>toolbar</strong> has a number of available commands that are not included in
the default configuration.  To customize the toolbar, select
<kbd>Window:Customize Toolbar</kbd>.  In general, toolbar icons for commands 
relating to source packages are colored green and those relating to binary packages 
are blue.</p>

<p>When <strong>a command is running</strong>, the name of the command and (space
allowing) a list of the packages it applies to will appear as a text
message in the lower left-hand corner of the window.  When the command
is finished, a progress bar and the message "Updating table data" may
appear.  <a href="details/fc_tableupdate.html" target="_right">More detail</a>.</p>

<p>While either of these processes is underway, the menu and toolbar items for
running commands in FinkCommander will be disabled.  You can, however, <a href="#terminal" 
target="_right">choose to run another command in Terminal</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="terminate">Terminating Commands</a></h3>

<p>You can terminate commands by (1)  clicking the stop sign toolbar button, 
(2) pressing <kbd>cmd-.</kbd> on the keyboard or (3) selecting the 
<kbd>Tools:Terminate Command</kbd> menu item.</p>

<h3><a name="binary">Source vs. Binary</a></h3>

<p>The commands under the <kbd>Source</kbd> menu are run by the fink
package manager.  The commands under the <kbd>Binary</kbd> menu are
run by apt-get.  In general, fink handles packages available as source
code and apt-get handles packages available in binary form.  Hence the
menu names.</p>

<p>This dichotomy, however, does not always hold true.  For
example, if you install a source code package,
remove it and then reinstall it before a newer version becomes
available, the fink package manager will use the dpkg command to 
reinstall an archived binary package that it has stored on your system.</p>

<h3><a name="terminal">Running Commands in Terminal</a></h3>

<p>If you choose a command from the <kbd>Source:Run in Terminal</kbd> or 
<kbd>Binary:Run in Terminal</kbd> submenu, a new terminal window will open with
the name of the command in the window title and the command will run in that window
rather than in FinkCommander.  You may be prompted for your password in the Terminal.
The same option is available via the table's contextual menu and a number of optional
toolbar items.</p>

<p>You can if you wish use this option to run a second fink command while another command
is being run in FinkCommander, but you should exercise care in doing so.  Simultaneously running 
incompatible commands, such as installing a package while removing one of the package's
dependencies, will have unpredictable results.</p>
