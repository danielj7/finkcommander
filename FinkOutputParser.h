 FinkCommander

 Graphical user interface for Fink, a software package management system
 that automates the downloading, patching, compilation and installation of
 Unix software on Mac OS X.

 The FinkOutputParser class parses the output from a fink or apt-get command
 and returns signals to FinkController indicating whether interaction with the user
 or GUI changes are necessary.  In some cases FinkController will send messages back
 asking for additional information, such as the name of the package currently
 being handled by Fink or the amount of increment to add to the progress indicator.
 FinkOutputParser also reads and stores the process group id for a command for possible
 later use in terminating the command.
