 FinkCommander

 Graphical user interface for Fink, a software package management system
 that automates the downloading, patching, compilation and installation of
 Unix software on Mac OS X.

 FinkInstallationInfo models the state of the user's fink installation and
 development tools.  The information it provides is used primarily to create
 the email sig for reports to package maintainers.
