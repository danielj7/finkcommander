<h2>Learning About Your Fink Packages</h2>

<p>FinkCommander provides several ways to learn about the software
packages you have installed with Fink.   All of the commands are applied
to the packages you have selected in the main window table.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>File:Open .info/.patch</dt>
    
        <dd><p>Also accessible by double clicking or dragging and dropping the
        selected packages.</p>

        <p>Opens the files used by Fink to install packages from source.  Double-clicking
		and drag and drop open both the .info and .patch files.  Drag
		and drop can also be used to copy these files to Finder
        windows or the Desktop.</p></dd>

	<dt>Tools:Browse Package Files</dt>

		<dd><p>Also accessible from: contextual menu for table, toolbar
		button.</p>
		
		<p>Opens a Finder-like window showing the files installed by Fink for
		the selected package.  You can open multiple windows with this command, but it
		can only be applied to one table selection at a time.</p>
		
		<p>Buttons in the upper left-hand corner allow you to
		switch between an outline or browser view.  You can open files displayed 
		in the window with <kbd>File:Open Selected File(s)</kbd> or by double clicking.  
		You can also open files or copy them to Finder via drag and drop.</p>
		
		<p>Using the browser view for the larger packages can consume a pretty big 
		chunk of memory.  The memory is released back to the system, however, when
		you close the window.  The outline view, in contrast, has a much smaller
		memory footprint, which is why it's set as the default.</p></dd>

    <dt>Tools:Go to Package Documentation</dt>
        
        <dd><p>Also accessible from: contextual menu.</p>
        
        <p>Opens a Finder window for the package documentation directory
        installed as part of the Fink package.</p></dd>
        
    <dt>Tools:Show Package Info</dt>
    
        <dd><p id="info">Also accessible from: contextual menu, toolbar
        button.</p>
        
        <p>Opens a window showing the Fink description for whichever package 
        or packages are selected in the table.  The description includes live
        links to the web page for the package and the package maintainer's 
        email address.</p></dd>
