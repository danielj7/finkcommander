<h2>Configuring FinkCommander and Fink</h2>

<p>The FinkCommander Preferences Panel is divided into six tab views: 
Commander, Fink, Downloads, Path, Display and Environment.  
The Fink and Downloads tab views allow you to change the fink configuration
settings stored in the <dfn>fink-basepath</dfn>/etc/fink.conf file.</p>

<p>This help file describes the purpose of a preference item when it may not
be self-evident.</p>

<h3>Fink</h3>

<dl>
	<dt><a name="unstable">Use unstable packages/unstable cryptography
	packages</a></dt>
	<dd><p>You can use these items to switch easily and quickly between using
	unstable packages and not using them.  After you make a change here and
	click OK or Apply, the table will update itself to reflect the change.</p>

	<dt>Keep the build directory</dt> 
	<dd><p>From the fink man page:  The default is false, fink  usually  removes 
    the  source build directory after successfully building a package. If you 
    want to keep the build directory, set this to  true.  Usually  only 
    developers have any need for this field.</p></dd>

	<dt>Keep the root directory</dt> 
	<dd><p>From the fink man page: Similar to  the  KeepBuildDir  option, 
	this allows developers to  keep the root directory around for debugging
	purposes.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Downloads</h3>

<dl>
	<dt>Use HTTP proxy/FTP proxy</dt>
	<dd><p>Set these items to the appropriate values if you are running Fink
	from behind a firewall.  What are the appropriate values?  Heck if I
	know.</p></dd>
	
	<dt>Passive mode FTP</dt>
	<dd><p>Because active FTP is deprecated, and some servers require passive
	mode, it is recommended that you leave this option on. </p></dd>
	
	<dt>Download method</dt>
	<dd><p>Mac OS X comes with curl, so it's the default.  You'll need to
	install wget or axel before switching.</p>
</dl>

<dl>

<h3>Paths</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>Path to Fink files</dt>
	<dd><p>Only change the settings here if FinkCommander was unable to locate
	the path to your Fink installation on startup.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Display</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>Limit output scrollback to ____ lines</dt>
	<dd><p>Use this setting to keep FinkCommander from consuming excessive
	amounts of memory when performing long installs (e.g. gnome, kde).</p></dd>

	<dt>Scroll to the last selection after sorting the table</dt>
	<dd><p>If this option is selected, the table will automatically scroll the
	last selection back to its previous position after you sort the table
	contents, just like Mail.app.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Environment</h3>

<p>Use this table to set environment variables needed for fink or apt-get to
run on your system.  A few default settings are established for you.  If you
lose functionality after making changes here, click <kbd>Restore</kbd> to
bring back the default settings.</p>
