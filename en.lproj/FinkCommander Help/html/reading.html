<h2>Reading the Table</h2>

<h3>Installed, Binary, Unstable, Stable Columns</h3>

<p>These columns show the appropriate version number for the category in question.  By comparing
the Binary version number with those in the other columns, you can tell whether running 
<kbd>Binary:Install</kbd> for a package will install the most recent available version or at 
least the most recent available stable version. See <a href="running.html#binary" target="_right">
Running Commands:Source v. Binary</a> for more details on the distinctions between source and binary
commands.</p>

<p>The version numbers presented are those available for installation, taking into account whether
you have <a href="configuring.html#unstable" target="_right">enabled</a> the installation of 
unstable packages.</p>

<h3>Latest Column</h3>

<p>This column serves primarily as a more concise alternative to the specific 
version columns described above.  It shows the most recent version of the package available 
to you.</p>

<h3>Status Column</h3> 

<p>&quot;Current&quot; means you have the most current available version of a package installed.  
&quot;Outdated&quot; means that the package is installed, but a more recent version is available.
&quot;Archived&quot; means that you previously installed the package but removed it so that only
the debian archive remains on your system or that you ran the build command for a package
but have not yet installed it.  (This information appeared in the Installed column
in version 0.3.3a and earlier.)</p>

<h3>Finding Packages</h3>

<p>FinkCommander provides two handy tools for finding the packages you
might be interested in installing or removing:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can sort the table by clicking on the column headers,
just as you can in Mail and other applications.  Click a header twice
in a row to reverse the sort order.</p></li>

<li><p>The toolbar in its default configuration includes a filter
that can be applied to most of the fields in the table.  The filter
works incrementally, so that as you type or delete characters, the
contents of the table change to include only those packages that
satisfy your search criteria.  The package count also changes to 
reflect the table contents.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By combining the use of sorting and filtering, you can effectively
search the table with two criteria.</p>

<p>The table colums, by the way, can be resized and moved, and any
changes you make will be saved between runtimes.</p>
