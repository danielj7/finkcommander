 FinkCommander

 Graphical user interface for Fink, a software package management system
 that automates the downloading, patching, compilation and installation of
 Unix software on Mac OS X.

 This file, Launcher.c and getpath.c are used to build the setuid root Launcher tool which runs 
 fink and apt-get commands, terminates those commands at the request of the user and
 writes changes to fink.conf.
