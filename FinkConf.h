 FinkCommander

 Graphical user interface for Fink, a software package management system
 that automates the downloading, patching, compilation and installation of
 Unix software on Mac OS X.

 The FinkConf class serves as a model for the /sw/etc/fink.conf configuration
 file.  Its methods are used by FinkPreferences to modify the file and thus
 configure fink itself.  It sends a notification to FinkController which 
 triggers the launchCommandWithArguments: method to make changes that require 
 root privileges.
